**Compare against RF and Logistic Regression models.  The metrics can be: F1-score, confusion matrix. What do you observe? What all digits are commonly confused?**



 **Contrast this with the t-SNE for the same layer but for an untrained model. What do you conclude?**


 **Now, use the trained MLP to predict on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. What do you observe? How do the embeddings (t-SNE viz for the second layer compare for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images)**
